Hello and welcome to the Robot Controller project.

To run the project, you need to clone the repository into Visual Studio. Copy and paste the repository location:

**Note:** The project uses .NET Framework 8.0.

## Testing the Application

When you start the app, try to test this example to make sure it is working correctly:

**Example:**
1. Enter the width of the floor: `5`
2. Enter the depth of the floor: `5`
3. Enter the start X coordinate: `2`
4. Enter the start Y coordinate: `1`
5. Enter the orientation: `N`
6. Enter the navigation commands: `RFRFFRFRF`, then hit enter.

The app will display a wire mesh with the end robot moving point, and the report should be: `Report: 1 3 N`.
